        James spent three years at Heriot-Watt University studying towards a degree in computer science but didn’t finish his degree as his wish was to pursue a career in hospitality. Starting behind some of Edinburgh’s bars and clubs, over the years James became well known nationally and internationally in the cocktail bar and restaurant scene. James has worked as a bartender, manager, operations manager, and operator to name a few of the positions he has held. He has also consulted on bar projects reaching as far as the Cayman Islands.

        James’ main skill in hospitality is as a trainer. In 2014 he joined the world-famous London Cocktail Club group of bars as the group bar manager where his role was to train and develop the teams. He developed a game-changing training program that linked his love for hospitality with his understanding of tech. A simple excel based system to record staff training progress made the role much more efficient. Six years later James’ system is still used at LCC. James has trained bartenders as far as the Philippines and has worked on projects with well-known brands such as the Prince's Trust.

        Since the hospitality sector was effectively shut down due to the global pandemic in 2020 James has been rediscovering his tech origins, starting with some software testing and now working on several web design jobs for people within the hospitality sector. He is looking to start working full time in the tech sector.

        James joined the CodeNation Develop course to refresh his skills learned at University and to learn how coders work in a professional setting. He is hoping to move on to do the 12-week apprenticeship course after Develop is completed.
