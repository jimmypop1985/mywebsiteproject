        <h3>Describe the role of IT in modern business</h3>
        <p>
            “organizations are increasingly turning IT into a driving force in all aspects of business.” [forbes.com] <a href = "https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2016/07/26/the-changing-role-of-it-in-the-future-of-business/#4f42161525d5">[1]</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            To describe IT’s role in modern business we must first understand what IT is. Outside of the professional environment, we manage our lives through phones, communicate through apps, pay for things online, or speak to friends on the other side of the planet. Simply put, IT is a way of making life easier, a way of making life better.
            <br>
            <br>
            Modern businesses now use IT as the driving force for their business, IT departments are experiencing tremendous changes as their roles expand to impact customer service, sales, and even business strategies.[1 ] As someone that has run small companies I truly understand the impact that useful IT solutions can have in all aspects of a business, from marketing and communication to compliance and admin. 
            IT is there to create solutions for problems, it is a service that should be designed to make its customers' lives easier. It doesn’t make businesses successful, people do. IT’s role is a more subtle, humble one and it grows in influence every day.

            Describing the methods, skills, and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully? What tools? What skills?
            <br>
            <br>
            Having the ability to code alone isn’t enough to complete a digital project, you need some core methods, skills, and tools that help ensure an efficiently completed product. Project management is a key part of the process. All tasks must be broken down into manageable pieces and then delegated to the appropriate members of the team. There are a lot of project management methodologies out there, each with their strengths and weaknesses. 
            <br>
            <br>            
            One such methodology is agile, where teams will develop the software in iterations that contain mini increments of the new functionality. This allows software to be released in increments. Agile methods can, however, be labour intensive and require real-time communication between users. There are several different types of agile methods such as scrum, crystal, extreme programming (XP), and feature-driven development (FDD). Agile methods can be used in conjunction with others as hybrids. 
            <br>
            <br>            
            The most traditional methodology is the waterfall method, which follows a rigid, linear process consisting of rigid, sequential phases Each phase must be complete before the next phase can be started. It is an easy approach to understand and manage. It can be slow and costly due to its rigid nature.<a href = "https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/top-4-software-development-methodologies/" target = "_blank">[2]</a> 
            <br>
            <br>            
            Other than the obvious coding ability, a software team needs to have many skills at their disposal. A development team having acumen is important for both the client and the development team themselves. Clients will find it difficult to place their trust in you if you struggle with budgeting, contract management, and negotiating skills. There are tools that the project manager can use to help with these processes, for example, YNAB is a popular and powerful tool for budgeting. <a href = "https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/top-4-software-development-methodologies/" target = "_blank">[2]</a>" target = "_blank">[3]</a> If you want your clients to give you the contract, the first key stage is gaining their confidence in your professionalism. Communication is key throughout the process, the ability to clearly and appropriately interact with all stakeholders is fundamental to the successful completion of a project. Companies use emails, phone calls, video conferencing or even workflow specific methods of communication such as slack to convey the information to their teams and clients. With the coding itself, there are several code editors that make the job more efficient. I like to use Visual Studio, it’s free and powerful. There are some applications that you can pay for with some extra functionality, like Adobe Dreamweaver.
            <br>
            <br>
            The list of tools and resources available to help complete a software project is massive and growing constantly. Each project has different needs, budgets, and people within it. Developers need to be flexible in their approach and be able to use the correct tools and methods for any particular job based on its requirements. The skills needed in the industry are all-encompassing as the industry grows as a fundamental aspect of any business. IT professionals need to be creative, dynamic, business savvy, and understand customer service principles to name a few.

        <h3>Plan and carry out tasks using IT - eg. Making your website. How will you plan it? Including a link to your Trello board.</h3>
        <p>To plan my project I will follow an agile project management methodology and a workflow management methodology known as Kanban. To manage this workflow methodology I will create a Trello board. Trello is project management software that allows users to organise their projects. <a href = "https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban" target = "_blank">[4]</a> To follow the Kanban method, I will create the lists ‘To do’, ‘Doing’, and ‘Done’. I can extend on this by adding some of my own lists, ‘Proof-Reading and Grammarly’ to review my work and make sure it reads professionally, ‘For Review‘ to allow our tutor, Liam to review, and ‘Useful Links’ for any extra information I use to help me complete the projects. Within Trello, tasks can be broken down into cards. These cards can be assigned labels, have lists created within them and allow for any people on the board to comment, view, or edit. Once a card is complete I will move it to the next relevant list. In my limited experience, I like using Trello, it is easy to use, has lots of functionality and it makes managing my projects easier. After the Trello board is complete I will answer the questions for the project. I will combine research with my own opinions to create content that is interesting to read and informed.
            <br>
            <br>
            The next stage of the process will be development. I will plan my development by creating a flowchart using draw.io. This will map out all the pages on my site and how they will link to each other. At this point I will also decide on any easter eggs I might include in the project. This information can then be added to Trello as cards and can be plugged into my workflow. Once the flowchart is complete I will decide the look and feel of the website. It will be a modern, minimalist site with a professional theme. After this is done, coding will begin!

        <h3>Describe the risks that impact digital projects - What causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>
        <p>In project management, risk is the likelihood of something not going to plan [5]. Here we will explore some of the situations that could go wrong in a project and established situations to mitigate them. During a project some factors are outside of your control, the market is one of them, for example, if you are designing a new piece of software there is a chance that a competitor could be doing the same thing. This is common in any business and there is nothing you can do to stop it. It is possible, though, to work around it if you have assessed that risk, for example, you could target a different corner of the market, or change your plan to get the software out earlier to get an advantage over the competition. Internally many scenarios could occur, for example, you are working on an ambitious project, but it is a startup and the client suddenly reallocates the budget to another department leaving you with fewer resources than originally planned for. In this case, you would recognise the risk early on and have a plan B to mitigate this risk.
        <div>
            <img id = "known" src="images/knownunknown.png" alt="known unknown matrix">
            <a href = "https://medium.com/@sisifocalavera/known-unknown-matrix-60bbf436d420" target= "_blank">[10]</a>

        </div>


            A good digital project planning process will have the “Known/Known” risks built-in as well as the Known/Unknown. The Known/Known plan will involve coming up with a Plan B along with the contingency plan for resources such as time allocation, budget, and your team. A good planning process will also address the “Known/Unknown” risks with the idea of preventing them, and if that is not possible, coming up with a Plan B to mitigate. There will always be risks in a project that will fall into the bottom two quadrants, this is part and parcel of the project management reality. However, if you can identify them or learn to understand them through thorough risk assessment they will move into the top quadrant of the matrix and can be mitigated. Risk assessment is about being thorough, critical, and realistic to come up with a plan for any eventuality during a project. <a href = "https://www.interruptdelivers.com/themash/what-is-risk-in-a-digital-project-and-why-should-i-care"  target = "_blank">[5]</a>

        <h3>Describe how you would go about selecting IT systems and software - how do you select the right kind of technology for the job. 
        </h3>
        <p>The main factors that will affect the IT systems and software you will use will be budget and the specific requirements of the job. If the job doesn’t require high-end graphics or processes that require high-speed processing, it may be unnecessary to purchase top of the range MacBook pros for your team. Conversely, a cheaper laptop might not be able to do the jobs you require efficiently. You may wish to use the free version of some software to allow some budget for some paid software. A start-up might have a very small budget so it may be necessary to hustle a bit and use cheaper resources whereas an established company doing animation might need a fleet of expensive hardware and premium animation studio software to complete the job. The role of the project manager is to sensibly and creatively manage the resources at hand and make the best decision for it.

        <h3>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. - How has Trello helped you plan and how can GIT and GitHub help you with your codes version control.

        </h3>
        <p>Trello has been invaluable to me during this course. I like having a tool that is easy to use to help me organise myself. I feel it will help me even more in the future when I am managing bigger projects. I have previous experience in coding but the project management solutions we have learned in this course have given me a real insight into how people work professionally in this industry. GitHub allows me to go back to previous versions of my files which helps a lot if I have made a mistake or if I need to bring back something that was previously deleted. It is also handy when working as a part of a team as it is cloud-based software and allows teams to coordinate together on single projects in real-time. <a href = "https://blog.devmountain.com/git-vs-github-whats-the-difference/"target = "_blank">[7]</a>  </p>

        Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects - How does GDPR impact digital projects?
        </h3>
        <p>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an European law covering privacy and security. If an organisation collects or uses data from people in the EU, it is required to adhere to GDPR. Breaches of this law can result in hefty fines for a company. GDPR regulates how companies can use people’s personal data and gives those companies accountability for what they do with it. It outlines the measures that must be taken to secure people’s information, regulations on how people consent to how their data is used and when you are allowed to process someone's data.[7]GDPR is there to give people who put their data online the confidence that it is being used appropriately and legally. There have been some much publicised cases of companies using people's data without their express permission, creating the need for this law. In the real world companies must have transparency on how they will use an individuals data and explicitly ask for permission to use it. <a href = "https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/" target = "_blank">[11]</a></p>
