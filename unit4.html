            <p>
                I decided to take a clean, modern and professional theme for my website. There would be a home page and a page for each of the four sections of learning outcomes. These would be presented as a navigation bar next to my name and the title of the project in the header of the site. Below this would be a horizontal row of flexboxes with the answers to the questions. The flexboxes would be collapsible, animated and made different colours for a striking design, I decided to import the fonts Oswald and Cairo for the headers and body respectively. The home (about) page will contain information on my professional history, current situation, my reasons for participating in the CodeNation course and a simple gallery of images.

        <h3>Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h3>

            Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.” -Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web

            Web accessibility means that any sites, tools, or applications that end up on the web need to be designed in a way that caters for people who have disabilities, are older, live in rural areas or developing countries can easily use them. A simple example would be that people who are visually impaired may need larger text or text-to-speech available to them in a site that allows them to use the site properly. Captions or subtitles can help those who are hard of hearing to understand video content. Having a clear contrast between foregrounds and backgrounds will assist those with poor contrast sensitivity, a common issue for people who are older. People with physical disabilities, for example, might need to use voice recognition software to interact with a computer. Accessibility issues must be considered during any development process as it is an essential aspect of the world wide web. <a href = "https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/" target = "_blank">[8]</a>

            There are lots of different types of files out there, often multiple types for the same thing, for example an image could be a jpeg or a png. This must be considered when developing a site as some filetypes might not be appropriate for what they are used for, for example, a .wav filetype is typically an uncompressed sound filetype and might take up a lot of space when downloaded whereas and mp3 file format is compressed and takes up less space. Some filetypes may need extra software to be downloaded to work, again this must be considered and perhaps an alternative filetype chosen. See some examples of different types of files below.<a href = "https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html" target = "_blank">[9]</a>
