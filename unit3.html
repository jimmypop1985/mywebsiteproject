        <h3>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency - could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>
        <p>
            Upon reflection the tools we had at our disposal were efficient and did the job we required them to do. The main drawback is the human factor. As we were learning the process whilst doing the project, it meant that I perhaps missed some opportunities for design and functionality due to my lack of experience. I also could have planned ahead a bit better as this assignment was more a journey of discovery over being something that was meticulously planned. As an example, I wanted  the collapsible menus to collapse when another one was selected. Initially I had this in code as a checkbox but when I realised that i needed this particular functionality I ended up having to change it to a radio which solved this problem. Working in groups would have helped as combined experience coupled with the ability to delegate tasks and bounce ideas off one another would have been helpful. I feel with better planning and more experience under my belt I could have done this project even better.

It is important to look after yourself if you want to do good work. Coding can be mentally taxing and you are sat still for most of the day. It is important to take regular breaks in order to move around and allow your brain to rest. Physical exercise, be it yoga, team sports or going to the gym help to compensate for the hours spent hunched over at a desk. Having a comfortable environment is also essential. You must sit in a comfortable chair that gives good posture. It is also important that you recognise when your brain is tired and if necessary, spend time away from the computer screen. Variety in a work day helps keep you fresh and interested.

        <h3>Develop solutions to improve your own productivity using IT in digital projects - what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
        </h3>
            <p>
                I would have spent more time in the planning phase and had everything meticulously planned out, as I occasionally had to reactively change snippets of code to fit what I needed there were some inefficiencies that arose because of this. I originally planned to use a flow chart to map out my plan but this didnâ€™t come to fruition. I feel it would have been a more complete project if I had worked in a group. It could have had more pages, content, functionality and design aspects if we had worked in a team with a project manager to take the lead, Trello to plan the project and slack to communicate.

        <h3>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions. </h3>

            Testing is an essential aspect of software development and must be a rigorous, planned procedure. I did some freelance software testing for a bit and I understand the process well.
            It is important firstly to identify all possible navigation routes or entries that the user can make and identify the expected result. Once this is done then a list of test cases can be identified with the expected results provided and the actual results given by the tester along with the steps to reproduce the actual result if an unexpected result is found. It is then sensible to provide any supporting information (screenshots, videos) to make the process clearer. Each test case can then go back to whoever developed it and the bug should be easier to fix.
