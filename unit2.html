        <h3>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed. </h3>
        <p>
            Overall I was very happy with the tools provided to me. In my limited coding experience I had before I used Adobe Dreamweaver which is great, but has a fee attached to it. I feel that the UI in Visual Studio Code is better and the shortcuts are more helpful. I will most likely continue to use Visual Studio Code in the future. Trello was very handy to me during this project. It allowed me to be thorough, organised and allowed me to keep a record of my ideas that I could use later in the process. I haven’t really used Google Docs before this assignment and again I think it’s brilliant for putting content into a website. It links easily with Trello, again it’s free and it does everything you would expect from a word processing program. I have gained real experience with tools I previously knew existed but never really used, mainly because of habit. I look forward to exploring other software to help me in my journey as a coder.

        <h3>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate, eg. Visual Studio code, Trello.</h3>
        <p>
           Visual Studio code is  a code editor that is easy to use, customisable and allows for plugins to be added to enhance its functionality. It is perfectly suited to this project as it is widely used by experts in the industry but is also very easy to learn. Trello is project management software that allows the planning of projects to be organised, shared with other people in your team and tasks to be labeled based on what stage of the development process they are at. It was great for this project but it perhaps shines best when used as part of a group task. On your own it isn’t much more than a to do list.  </a>

        <h3> Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project - are you happy with your website? Why? Why Not? You should review it in the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3>
        <p>
            Overall I am very happy with the website I created. I think it looks great, The colours are impactful, the content is well layout, the collapsible menus and animations are well done and add to the professional feel of the page. I managed to use some of the things we learned in the code alongside some stuff I managed to research on my own. There are a couple of things I would change with hindsight. There isn’t enough variety on the different pages, they all do the same thing but with different content. I would perhaps have changed this if I had more time.I would also perhaps use images instead of colours to add to the professional look of the site.

        <h3> Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
        <p>
            If I had some more time I would have added a better gallery and perhaps some shading to the colour block. I would also perhaps have looked into making some of the colours opaque and played around with the design a bit more. I would also have added a contact page where someone that uses the page could have contacted me through a message on the page but this would have required php to be done well. I probably would have looked in to adding some sounds and videos to the site too.

        <h3> Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose. 
        </h3>
        <p>

            I feel that my content on the site is fit for purpose, appropriate and well executed.The website is easy to navigate, free from errors and aesthetically pleasing. The code was written in Visual Studio Code, the planning was done on Trello and the content was developed using Google Docs. I felt it best to use different tools as it kept things organised and ensured my work was high quality. My code is indented where appropriate and should be easy to read, as is the content on the site. I used classes and CSS well to avoid having to repeat code and make the site uniform. Links have been used to navigate within the site and any links that go to an external site open a new tab. The images have had alternate text added to them for increased accessibility.and the file formats used (images only) are .PNG and .JPEG.
